menu impl
allow side-by-side menu options as well as vertical
scrolling
cursor move
typing, backspace, etc (elegant impl PLEASE)
ctrl+q to quit, ctrl+alt+q to force
  -> get rid of esc to quit - instead we can use that to exit menus,
     multiple cursors, other contextual stuff
save file (& warning menu on close w/o save)
ctrl+(shift|alt)+s to save as new file
start empty, ctrl+o to open file
multiple files in different tabs
  -> scrollable on overflow
  -> drag/drop to reorder, divider becomes bold at insert location
ctrl+n for new file, when saved it goes to save as
command line arg parser
scroll bar
highlighting
copy/paste w/ v clipboard lib
syntax highlighting w/ textmate
workspace file browser
ctrl+f to find in file, ctrl+(shift|alt)+f to find in workspace
ctrl+(shift|alt)+o to open new workspace (closes the current one)
find yaml lib? or write one it can't be that hard...
<home>/.vcoder/config.yaml
platform-independent settings module - can find "home" dir
settings menu
  -> text tab format (tabs/spaces)
       -> impl rendering tabs as spaces, but saving as tabs
       -> vs code will shit itself - enforce spaces? -> space count is configurable
  -> pre-written commands
ctrl+r to run pre-written command, ctrl+(shift|alt)+r to run arbitrary (output where?)
editing extras
  -> ctrl+backspace to delete word
  -> shift+cursor move to highlight (works w/ end, home, up, down, etc)
  -> multiple cursors?
       -> alt-click to add new
       -> configurable blink speed
       -> hide actual term cursor, instead highlight & blank characters
